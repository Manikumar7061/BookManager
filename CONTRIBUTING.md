# Contributing to Scoof Kindle

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Scoof Kindle as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit your pull request!

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/scoof-kindle/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style in the project:

- For the frontend (React), we follow the standard [React/JSX style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
- For the backend (Node.js), we follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- We use TypeScript for type safety. Please maintain type definitions.
